# Rincon-Entropy
Implementation of Rincon’s Incremental Entropy Algorithm on a UNIX system

- To Demonstrate knowledge in OS, compilers and x86 architecture, I Implemented Rincon’s Incremental Entropy Algorithm (DOI: 10.1109/CISS56502.2023.10089704) to reduce the number of task migrations while generating the same amount of job migrations.
- Developed the algorithm using C and C++, used POSIX sockets, pthreads, semaphores in a client-server architecture for thorough testing
